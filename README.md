Welcome to the homepage of CTC!

There are three folders, and five files in the root folder. We introduce each of them as follows:

- gcc-test: which contains code for testing GCC. The code for testing GCC. More specifically, there are two files and one folder in this folder:
  - gcc_test.py, is code for GCC testing.
  - csmith_multi_tools.py, is code for test program generation in GCC testing.
  - tools, which contains implementations of basic functions in CTC, such as file read-write operation and optimization sequence reduction.

- llvm-test: which contains code for testing LLVM. The code for testing LLVM. More specifically, there are two files and one folder in this folder:
  - llvm_test.py, is code for LLVM testing.
  - llvm_multi_tools.py,is code for test program generation in LLVM testing.
  - tools, which contains implementations of basic functions in CTC, such as file read-write operation and optimization sequence reduction.

- subject, which contains our experiment subject files. 

- SamplingCAPlus_final, which is the tool that generates t-wise covering array.

Thanks!
